* DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* DNS: Domain Name System
* HSRP: hot standby routing protocol
* LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol
* NTP: Network Time Protocol
* SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol
* STP: spanning tree protocol
* TACACS+: Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
* VLAN: virtual local area network
